## What?
A Gridsome (VueJS) blog with Markdown support.

## Why?
Because I wanted to:
-   learn Gridsome
-   improve my VueJS skill
-   have more to show
-   experiment with the VueJS equivalent of Gatsby (which I haven't used because I'm not familiar with React _yet_) to see if it would suit a company I'm working with

## How?
By following the gridsome tutorial [here](https://alligator.io/vuejs/gridsome-blog/) and [here](https://alligator.io/vuejs/gridsome-list-posts/) and customising it to my liking.

## When?
The 8th of March 2019.
